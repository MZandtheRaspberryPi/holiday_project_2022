# Planning

This is a project that a group of friends are taking on towards the holidays in 2022. We thought it would be fun to build a project together involving electronics and a little coding.  

First, we need to decide on a project idea and requirements. We will try and keep it relatively small, quick, and cheap. Then we will plan out the hardware, software, and design. We will make a prototype and do a proof of concept. Then we will order components for everyone in the group and build it all together.
